# NOTE ABOUT JAVA VERSION
# The Android Gradle Plugin used by this project requires Java 11 (or newer) at build time.
# Your Gradle run failed because it used a Java 10 runtime.
# Two easy ways to fix this:
# 1) Install a JDK 11+ and set the system environment variable JAVA_HOME to point to it.
#    Example (Windows cmd.exe):
#      setx JAVA_HOME "C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-17.0.8"
#      REM then re-open your terminal or restart the shell
#    Or (temporary, current session only):
#      set JAVA_HOME="C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-17.0.8"
# 2) OR point Gradle specifically to a JDK installation by setting org.gradle.java.home
#    in this file. Remove the leading '#' and update the path to your JDK 11+ installation.
#    Example (uncomment and edit accordingly):
# org.gradle.java.home=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-17.0.8
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Point Gradle to a JDK 11+ installation. Using Android Studio's JBR (Java 21) is acceptable for the build.
org.gradle.java.home=C\:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jbr
